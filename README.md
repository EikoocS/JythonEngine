If you need a server scripting plugin, also try [wrench](https://github.com/EikoocS/wrench), which uses JS to do event listening, compositing table registration, etc. It supports paper and Folia, etc.
## Introduction

JythonEngine is a wrapper of Jython, which can be used to control the server through the console, and can be used to get the output of the console at the same time. It supports two running modes, syncronous and asyncronous. It is compatible with Bukkit's thread unsafe, and can be used to achieve higher efficiency of running.

Thanks to the Jython implementation, Python and Java can easily interoperate, giving Jython scripts the power of plug-ins, while Jython's own scripts can be run directly without a compiler, reducing the extra time spent on debugging and compiling and packaging.

Interactive console with instant feedback for immediate operation, significantly reducing deployment time overhead
